                        Rosebank College, an IIE institution, is where my IT path began. It was here that I discovered the 
                        benefits that IT networks offer their users and the significant influence they have on our daily lives.
                        This gave me a better understanding of technology, how it might benefit businesses in their operations 
                        and how it connects the world.

                    To obtain experience and apply my knowledge, I approached The Hill High School, where I had formerly attended.
                     I enjoy assisting educators and other staff members understanding how to use information technology 
                     in their job and daily life. As well, <a href="solution.html"><b>solve any IT network concerns</b></a>.

                Here at Jumpco, I was able to learn the fundamentals of Java. I also learned 
                about the software life cycle and how networks serve as a platform for software 
                deployment, allowing consumers to access apps. Using these platforms I also learned 
                how to manage software resources for optimal application performance. Seeing how Java, 
                SQL, XAMP, Php and Github collaborate to bring online services such as websites to life
                 has helped me understand the other side of IT. Which has led to the sharpening of other 
                 skills as well.
