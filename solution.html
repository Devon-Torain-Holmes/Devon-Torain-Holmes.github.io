          <p>
          The best way I found to solve any IT Network problem was with the UAP method, which stands for Understand, Apply and Practice.
          </p>

          
          <p>
             This basis method helped me solve many network issues and network assignment questions.It 
              works by breaking down the problem or issue into stages of understanding and practical viewpionts, 
              to help you to recognize the root problem.
          </p>

          <p>
          Lets see how it works.

      <tr>
          <td><b>U</b></td>
          <td><b>Understanding.</b><br><br>  First understand the topic in depth. Go to the
             internet and learn as much as you can on the topic, on the question
              being asked or IT problem at hand. You should understand it so much so that you can explain
               it to a child. (Fineman technique).
              <br>
              <br>
              Once you understand it to that level add more detail. Study it in
              depth by learning how it works, and it does not work.

            practice of what you have learned.
